# Yelp_Camp
This is the final project of 'The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt  Steele' course. 
The site is a clone of yelp! reviews, but is built so that it reviews various campgrounds all around the world.
It is built using the Express framework of Node.js, with MongoDb as its database.
The front-end is styled mostly using Bootstrap and Css.
It is hosted with the help of Heroku's free plan and the remote mongoDb database is from Mongo Atlas.
